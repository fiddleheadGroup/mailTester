mailTester

This project tests the main libraries from project acorn.  It enables the user to set up many different mailing test
suites to test things like deliverability, bounces, etc.  Some bugs exist in this code due to code paths not typically
followed during testing.  Project acorn official code has since forked from this testing program, but this is a good
basic utility to provide email regression testing.

Feedback and bug fixes welcome!!
